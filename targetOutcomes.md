For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.2. Results. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 2.2. Results

> All trials featuring a repeat of the target (i.e., text color) or distractor (i.e., word) presented on the previous trial were excluded from analysis, as was the first trial of each block. Only accurate responses following an accurate response were included in the following analyses, except for the measure of error rate, which included inaccurate responses. Removing errors and trials preceded by an error resulted in the additional exclusion of 7.0% of the remaining valid trials (SD = 5.7%) per participant on average. Performance was analyzed with a series of 2 (current trial congruency: C vs. I) × 2 (previous trial congruency: c vs. i) ANOVAs.

> 2.2.1. Initiation time

> As predicted, initiation times conformed to the pattern of effects proposed to underlie the response threshold adjustment process (cC < iC < cI < iI; see Fig. 2A). Initiation times revealed a main effect of current trial congruency, with higher initiation times on incongruent relative to congruent trials, F(1, 23) = 18.95, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.45, and a significant main effect of previous trial congruency, F(1, 23) = 5.95, p = 0.023, ηp2 = 0.21, with higher initiation times on trials preceded by an incongruent relative to a congruent trial. No interaction between current and previous trial congruency was observed, F(1, 23) = 0.183, p = 0.67.

> 2.2.2. Reach curvature

> Consistent with our second prediction, reach curvatures conformed to the pattern of effects previously linked to the monitoring component of cognitive control in the Stroop task (cC = iC < iI < cI; see Fig. 2B). Reach curvatures revealed a main effect of current trial congruency, with larger reach curvatures on incongruent relative to congruent trials, F(1, 23) = 19.05, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.45. A significant main effect of previous trial congruency was also observed, F(1, 23) = 5.33, p = 0.03, ηp2 = 0.19, with larger curvatures on trials preceded by a congruent relative to an incongruent trial. Further, a significant interaction between previous and current trial congruency was observed, F(1, 23) = 6.98, p = 0.015, ηp2 = 0.23. Follow-up tests revealed larger reach curvatures on cI than iI trials, F(1, 23) = 8.48, p = 0.008, ηp2 = 0.27. No effect of previous trial type was found on congruent trials, F(1, 23) = 0.009, p = 0.92. Further, reach curvatures were significantly larger on iI than iC trials, F(1, 23) = 5.60, p = 0.027, ηp2 = 0.20.
